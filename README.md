# Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to determine what users would like this service if moved from NYC to Iowa. Based on the NYC data we could determine a target customer base and where to feature our product

## Results
The results show that most of the users of this service are professional men, using this service to bike to work. It also shows that these professionals are repeat users during the work week and will be interested in purchasing a subsription based plan.

## Summary
I think the data shows that we should offer subscription services in the uptown area and focus on men with discounts offered to women riders. I would also add in a visualation/data point of location of the rides to show that it is in fact in the city and not across the entire state.
